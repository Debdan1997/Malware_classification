Static Analysis


Language:-

Python 3.6.9


Packages and libraries used:-

os, sys, random, json, numpy, ast, pickle, sklearn


Running the file:- 

In order to run the file, make sure that the 'model' file and 'preprocess_new.py' are in the same directory as that of the primary script 'dynamic.py'.
Open up a terminal in the same directory and run the file using python3. Provide the path to the test folder as a command line argument. This will generate a file called 'dynamic.csv' in the same directory as the script. 

sample usage:

	~$ python3 dynamic.py test_data

note1:- 

For the test vectors to be properly generated, all the json files of benignwares/malwares should be in the same test directory. I.e. the malwares shouldn't be kept in nested directories such as 'Trojan', 'Virus' etc.
