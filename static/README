Static Analysis


Language:-

Python 3.6.9


Packages and libraries used:-

os, sys, random, json, numpy, ast, pickle, sklearn


Running the file:- 

In order to run the file, make sure that the 'model' file and 'preprocess_new.py' are in the same directory as that of the primary script 'static.py'.
Open up a terminal in the same directory and run the file using python3. Provide the path to the test folder as a command line argument. This will generate a file called 'static.csv' in the same directory as the script. 

sample usage:

	~$ python3 static.py test_data

note1:- 

For the test vectors to be properly generated, all the folders (each containing opcodes.txt, string.txt and structure_info.txt) of malwares/benignwares should be in the same test directory without any directory nesting. I.e. the malwares should not be kept in different folders like 'Trojan', 'Virus' etc inside the test directory.
